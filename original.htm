    <h2>My C# coding styles guidelines</h2>
    This coding guideline should help you write cleaner and more expressive C# code. It's my own (and i really emphasis own
    here) perspective on what makes code better and easier to read.
    However, the most important thing about coding guidelines is that you should have one. Even if you work alone and not part
    of a team, you should strive to make your code uniform and respect some coding guidelines.

    <h4 id="generic_advices">Generic advices</h4>
    - use long descriptive names. Don't shorten names needlessly. You have Intellisense, you're not typing all characters each time.
    <br /><br />
    - don't use abbreviation unless it's a very well know term.
    <br /><br />
    - keep in mind the quality of the variable names usually makes the difference between easily understandable code and incomprehensible one.
    <br /><br />
    - English should be the only language used when writing both code and comments.
    <br /><br />
    - don't use _ (or any other character for that matter) to abbreviate variables based on their location (or even worse, specific types). When reading code the variable location is not important and "Find all references" will "fix" this immediately.
    <br /><br />
    - succinct code is overall better as long as you don't overdo it.
    <br /><br />
    - one class per file, but you can make exceptions by grouping multiple related small classes in a single file.
    <br /><br />




    <h4 id="language_constructs">Language constructs</h4>
    <h5>Constants</h5>
    Constants should be declared all in uppercase :
    <br /><br />
    <code>
        public int FIXED_WEIGTH = 44;
    </code>
    <br /><br />
    Uppercase makes the constant values stand out when reading the code and it makes it very clear that particular value won't be changed anywhere in the code.

    <br />

    <h5>var keyword.</h5>
    Don't use the var keyboard (unless you write a LINQ query which returns a anonymous object because var is the only thing you can use in this situation). Consider the following piece of code :
    <br /><br />
    <code>
        var stuff = GetMyStuff();
    </code>
    <br /><br />
    This code can't be understood at first glance. You're writing code in a strong typed language and the actual type is not visible there.
    <br />

    <h5>Lambda expressions (versus anonymous functions)</h5>
    Personally i consider anonymous methods to be obsolete and encourage anyone to use lambdas everywhere. This code
    <br />
    <code>
        all.Find(delegate(e){
        return e.IsAvailable;
        })
    </code>
    <br /> has to much ceremony over this version
    <br />
    <code>
        all.Find(examples.IsAvailable);
    </code>
    <br /><br />
    With lambda expression just keep in mind that you should use a descriptive names to the lambda parameters IF you using more
    than one parameter (so don't use one char variables). If you have a single parameter it's fine to use a single char because
    you should infer the type from the collection's name.
    <br />

    <h5>LINQ queries</h5>
    Personally i'm not a big fan of the LINQ query syntax
    <br /><br />
    <code>
        IEnumerable&lt;int&gt;
        numQuery1 = from num in numbers
        <br />
        where num % 2 == 0
        <br />
        orderby num select num;
    </code>
    <br /><br />  and i do prefer to use method syntax
    <br /><br />

    <code>
        IEnumerable<int> numQuery2 = numbers.Where(num => num % 2 == 0).OrderBy(n => n);
    </code>

    <br /> <br />
    The reason is both code readability ( i find it a lot easier to read the method names rather than scan the code for the
    SQL like keywords) and also because you're not actually writing SQL there : just the fact that 'query' has to start with
    from instead of select (i know the reason for this, it's mostly related to providing Intellisense) but it's still something
    that somehow resembles SQL instead of the real deal.

    <br />
    <br />

    <h4 id="code_comments">Code comments</h4>
    I'm a firm believer in commenting code JUST when it needs comments. I see no value of littering the code with useless, obvious
    comments. Comments should be concise, to the point and most importantly they should explain the WHY is something done in a certain
    way.



    <h4 id="indentation">Indentation levels</h4>
    I use tabs for indentation because tabs are condifurable while spaces aren't. The indent size i use is 4 (i find 2 too narrow,
    specially when you read code on a +24 inch monitor and 8 too wasteful).
    <br />
    <code>
        Is Visual Studio open Tools/Options/Text Editor/C# to configure the indentation.
        <br />
    </code>

    <h4 id="linelength">Line length</h4>
    My advice is not to have a fixed length but "chop" the line where it makes sense. I personally
    find that having a fixed line length makes it harder to read the code in different scenarios (for instance....having the
    line length set to 80 chars makes the code look bad on a 24' 1080p monitor because the entire right side of the editor will
    be unused. Likewise having a 140 line length will be annoying when trying to code on a 14' laptop because you'll have to
    scroll horizontally all the time).
    <br /><br />
    One of the biggest antipatterns for this, is wrapping method parameters wrong (like this) :
    <br /><br />
    <code>
        public void DoLotsOfStuff(int x,)
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int y, int z,
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MoreCrap crap,
    </code>
    <br /><br />
    Nevermind the fact that is wasting space, don't put 1 parameter per line and the next line has 2 parameters. Overall it just makes thing harder to read.


    <h4 id="linebreaking">Line breaking </h4>
    In C# i prefer to *always* put the curly brackets on separate lines. So it's always :
    <br /><br />
    <code>
        public void DoStuff()
        <br />
        {
        <br />
        }
        <br />
    </code>
    <br />
    and never
    <br /><br />
    <code>
        public void DoStuff(){
        <br />
        }
    </code>
    <br /><br />
    When doing web development especially (and jumping between JavaScript/TypeScript and C#), it helps that code in each language has different linke breaking. Also , never skip the brackets. Don't write stuff like this :
    <br /><br />
    <code>
        if(stuffIsCorrect)
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; DoMoreStuff()
    </code>
    <br /><br />
    Instead put the curlies where they belong :
    <br /><br />
    <code>
        if(stuffIsCorrect)
        <br />
        {
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; DoMoreStuff()
        <br />
        }
    </code>
    <br />
    <br />
    Write compact code. For instance , as a example,
    <br /><br />
    <code>
        public bool IsAuthenticated
        <br />
        {
        <br />
        &nbsp; get
        <br />
        &nbsp;{
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;return User != null;
        <br />
        &nbsp;}
        <br />
        }
        <br />
    </code>
    <br />
    can be compacted as :
    <code>
        public bool IsDone<br />
        {
        <br />   get
        {<br />
        return Done != null;<br />
        }<br />
        }<br />
    </code>
    <br />
    <code> public bool IsDone => Done != null;</code>

    <br />
    <h4 id="memberstructure"> Member structure </h4>
    Inside a class my structure is always the same ( from top to bottom):
    <br /> - constants and readonly fields;
    <br /> - private and public variables.
    <br /> - delegates/events
    <br /> - constructors
    <br /> - properties
    <br /> - methods
